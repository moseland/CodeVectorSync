This project helps you keep your local code and documentation synchronized with a ChromaDB vector store. Making it possible to easily ask AI questions about your codebase, find related functions across projects, or even get context-aware suggestions directly from your own files.

CodeVectorSync monitors your specified project directories, processes files (like .py, .js, .md, etc.), chunks their content, generates embeddings using a local SentenceTransformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), and then stores these embeddings and their metadata in ChromaDB. It automatically detects new files, changes to existing files, and deletions, keeping your vector database up-to-date.

---

## Features
- Automatic Synchronization: Uses watchdog to monitor your project directories for changes.
- Intelligent Ingestion: Only processes new or modified files, saving time and resources.
- Local Embedding: Generates vector embeddings using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 SentenceTransformer model locally, so your code doesn't leave your machine for embedding generation.
- ChromaDB Integration: Seamlessly connects to your self-hosted or remote ChromaDB instance to store and manage code embeddings.
- Metadata Rich: Stores useful metadata like file_path, project_name, language, and chunk_id for powerful filtering and retrieval.
- Cleanup Utilities: Includes scripts to clear your ChromaDB collection or view its current statistics.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
A running ChromaDB instance (local or remote).

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moseland/CodeVectorSync.git
cd CodeVectorSync

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Update Configuration
Open ingest.py and modify the following variables to match your setup:

CHROMADB_HOST: Your ChromaDB server URL.

CHROMADB_COLLECTION_NAME: The name of the collection where your code embeddings will be stored.

PROJECT_ROOT_DIRECTORIES: A list of the root directories where your code projects are located.

INCLUDE_EXTENSIONS: File extensions to include in the ingestion process.

EXCLUDE_DIRS: Directories to ignore (like node_modules, .git, etc.).

### Usage
Start the ingestion and watcher script:
This will perform an initial scan of your configured directories and then start monitoring them for changes.

```bash
python ingest.py

Keep this script running in the background.

Check ChromaDB Statistics (Optional):
To see what's currently in your ChromaDB collection and get counts per project:

```bash
python stats.py

Clear the ChromaDB Collection (Use with Caution!):
If you want to completely wipe your code_knowledge_base collection (e.g., to start fresh), run:

```bash
python clear.py

WARNING: This action is irreversible and will delete all embeddings in the specified collection.
